# CNN for invasive species monitoring
In this project I am using a convolutional neural network that I wrote in Keras to predict whether or not there exists a rare
flower inside an image. The model, although simple, managed to get about 97% accuracy on the test set, which may not be state of the art, 
but considering that is running on my laptop with 0.8gb of V-RAM.

### Deep Learning Topics Applied on this project
  - Dropout
  - Data Augmentation
  - Image normalization
  - Cross Entropy Loss Function
  - Gradient Descent Optimization (Done by the tensorflow API)

### What is this project for?
As mentioned above this is my submission to the Kaggle Invasive Species Monitoring Dataset.

##### Disclaimer
This project isn't meant for production and is mostly an experimentation. I still am a novice Python programmer and as such the code design isn't all that great.
Also I do not own the dataset, please visit the kaggle page for legal information and licesing of the dataset.

##### Foot note
I hope that you find this project informative and educational. Keep on learning!
